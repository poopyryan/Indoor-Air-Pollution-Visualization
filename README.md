## About
Indoor air pollution remains a critical public health issue, especially in developing regions where access to clean cooking fuels is limited. The combustion of solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, and coal in poorly ventilated spaces can lead to severe respiratory illnesses and premature deaths.

Using data from Our World in Data, this project **explores the intersection of environmental health and economic development** by visualising the relationship between:
 - GDP per capita (PPP)
 - Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies
 - Deaths caused by indoor air pollution

Thus, **Our goal is to uncover patterns that can inform policy, drive equitable energy access, and ultimately reduce the global health burden associated with indoor pollution**.

## Data Overview
Source: Our World in Data

Files: Multiple CSVs merged into one cleaned dataset

Key Variables:
- Access to clean cooking technologies (% of population)
- GDP per capita (PPP, constant 2017 international $)
- Deaths caused by indoor air pollution
- Country, Continent, Year
- Population (for normalization)

## Tools Used
R Programming Language
 - `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`
 - `RMarkdown` for documentation
 - Data wrangling and transformation using `tidyverse`
